**Jarvis** is a lightweight, Python-based virtual assistant inspired by the iconic AI helper from popular culture. Designed to respond to voice commands, Jarvis seamlessly integrates multiple functionalities—from opening your favorite websites and playing music to fetching the latest news headlines and even handling more general queries with the help of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

### Key Features

- **Voice Activation & Command Processing:**  
  - Listens continuously for the wake word “Jarvis” using the SpeechRecognition library.
  - Processes subsequent voice commands, enabling hands-free control.

- **Text-to-Speech Feedback:**  
  - Uses pyttsx3 to deliver spoken responses, making interactions more natural.

- **Web Integration:**  
  - Opens popular websites such as Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, Spotify, Netflix, and GitHub with simple voice commands.
  - Leverages the webbrowser module for quick and reliable access.

- **Music Playback:**  
  - Integrates with a custom `musicLibrary` module to play specific songs based on voice input.

- **Real-Time News Updates:**  
  - Fetches the latest headlines from NewsAPI and reads them aloud, keeping you informed on current events.

- **AI-Driven Conversations:**  
  - For commands outside of predefined actions, Jarvis uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate concise, intelligent responses.
  - Easily handles a wide range of queries by delegating to an AI, ensuring versatility and a conversational experience.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization:**  
   - Upon starting, Jarvis greets you and enters a continuous listening mode.

2. **Listening for the Wake Word:**  
   - The system uses your microphone input to detect when you say “Jarvis.” Once detected, it prompts you for further instructions.

3. **Command Execution:**  
   - Depending on the command (e.g., opening a website, playing a song, or fetching news), Jarvis executes the corresponding action.
   - For more complex queries, the command is forwarded to the OpenAI API, and the AI-generated response is spoken back to you.

### Why Use Jarvis?

Jarvis combines simplicity with a rich set of features, offering a customizable and extendable platform for voice-activated control. Whether you’re looking to streamline your daily tasks, stay updated with the latest news, or experiment with AI integration in Python, Jarvis provides an excellent foundation.
